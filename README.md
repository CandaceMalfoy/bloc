# "It's All Relative"
*The Difference Between Absolute and Relative Positioning in CSS*  

**Relative Positioning** simply put, is moving an object relative to where it is then, and without moving any other items on the page.  For example, if you input 10px left and 10px top, the object would move 10px from the left and from the top (not move to the left). This change does not affect any of the other objects on the page, and is a great tool for precision.

**Absolute Positioning** Is when an object moves in relation to the parent element. However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned parent container, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
